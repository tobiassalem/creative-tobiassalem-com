Salem Creative is a young ambitious consultant firm focusing on the possibilities of science and technology to help improve the world and enrich peoples lives. 
The motivation for our work is multifaceted. At the very core it comes from an 
<strong>ambition to invent and improve things</strong>, something that has been with us since childhood. 
We strongly believe that for every problem there is always a solution, even though it may not always be what we have expected, and for every solution,
there is always a better one <strong>you have yet to discover.</strong>

Our ambition is to add experience, competence and a personal engagement to help reach the common goals in the best possible way.
Each challenge is a possibility to increase the understanding of the creative process and how science and technology works in human business.
Salem Creative is part of a network of several small companies who all live for their ambitions. Through this network we can help mediate
competence in areas including:

Our steadfast dedication to science and technology has evolved and grown with the experience of the amazing things it can accomplish.
Even though the future is unknown, when inherently valuable components meet, it often naturally results in
